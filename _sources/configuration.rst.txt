Configuration
=============

*mmSolver* can be customised using configuration files.  The default
configuration of *mmSolver* is stored in the installation directory
'config' sub-directory, but each file may be overridden by adding a
file into the home directory.

When a new configuration file with the exact file name as a default
config file is found, it replaces the original. Configuration files
do not accumulate values.

For documentation of the config utility module, see `mmSolver.utils.config`.

User Preferences
----------------

General user preferences affecting tools can be adjusted using the
*User Preferences...* window. Please see the :ref:`user-preferences-tool-ref`
page for details.

Overriding the mmSolver Shelf and Menus
---------------------------------------

To change the *mmSolver* shelf or menus, you may add or edit the
configuration files in the home directory. See the `Home Directory
Configuration` section for the specific directory.

To override the Maya 'mmSolver' shelf and/or menus, follow these steps:

#) Get the default config file.

   #) Go to the installed directory of mmSolver.

   #) Go to "config" directory.

   #) Copy the "shelf.json" and/or "menu.json" files.

#) Paste the config files into your home directory.

   #) Go to the Home Directory configuration for your operating system
      (~/.mmSolver on Linux), see `Home Directory Configuration`
      section below for details.

   #) Paste the files to be overwritten into this directory.

#) Edit the custom files

   #) Open the files in a Text Editor.

   #) Edit the files, but make sure to use JSON syntax.

   #) Save the files.

#) Restart Maya to see your changes.

.. note:: If the default files are overridden, any changes made to the
          default config files will be overridden by your custom
          shelf. For example, when a new mmSolver version is released,
          new shelves and menus may be added - these new menus will
          not be visible in the overridden configurations.

Home Directory Configuration
----------------------------

To store settings and preferences that persist after Maya is closed,
files are saved into the home directory.

The path for these changes are dependent on the Operating System:

- ``${HOME}/.mmSolver`` (on Linux)

- ``%APPDATA%\mmSolver`` (on Windows)

You can type these paths into your file manager (for example `Windows
Explorer`) to go to the directory.

All of your personal user-settings are stored inside the home
directory. Copying, or deleting these files will delete or transfer
the personal preferences too.

.. note:: Not all settings in mmSolver are stored in the home
          directory, some are stored in the Maya scene file directly.
