Transform nodes are used in mmSolver to define one or more of these features:

- A custom outliner icon for a node.

- A new node type for quickly finding in the Outliner or scene graph.

- A new node type customising the Maya Attribute Editor.

- Overriding the behavior of how a node is defined in 3D space.
