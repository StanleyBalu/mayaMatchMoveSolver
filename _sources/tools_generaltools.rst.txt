General Tools
=============

The tools on this page are not specific to Markers, Cameras or
Bundles, but are general tools useful in Maya for many different
tasks.

.. _center-2d-on-selection-tool-ref:

Center 2D On Selection
----------------------

Forces the active viewport camera to lock itâ€™s center to the currently
selected transform node.

A viewport camera can only center on one node at a time.

While centering is turned on, it overrides Maya's normal 2D Pan/Zoom
settings.

Usage to *apply* the centering effect:

1) Select transform node.

2) Activate a 3D viewport.

3) Run 'Apply 2D Center' tool.

   - The active viewport camera will be centered on the selected
     transform node.

4) Use the Pan/Zoom tool (default hotkey is backslash (' \\ ') key),
   to zoom in and out. Play the Maya timeline and use the centered view as
   needed.

Usage to *remove* centering effect:

1) Run 'Remove 2D Center' tool.

   - The active viewport will no longer center on an object, but will
     not reset the view.

   - The pan/zoom will still be active. To reset the viewport camera,
     turn off Pan/Zoom on the viewport camera (default hotkey is
     backslash (' \\ ') key).

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.centertwodee.tool as tool

    # Apply Centering onto active camera
    tool.main()

    # Remove Centering from active camera
    tool.remove()

.. _smooth-keyframes-tool-ref:

Smooth Keyframes
----------------

Smooth the selected keyframes in the Graph Editor, along with a UI to
change the affect of the Smoothing function. The UI values are saved
into the home directory and will be re-used when a new Maya session is
opened.

The Smooth Keyframes tool allows smoothing of only specific keyframes,
even if the curve is not baked per-frame. The tool will also attempt
to control the smoothed values as they blend into unsmoothed
values. This allows smoothing a specific area of an animation curve,
while preserving other parts and avoiding bumps at the boundry.

Usage:

1) Use the menu ``mmSolver > General Tools > Smooth Keyframes UI``.

2) Edit the options in the UI.

   - *Function* controls the type of smoothing that is calculated.

   - *Smooth Width* controls how much the smoothing function will be
     applied. The width is number of frames to be used for smoothing,
     for example a value of 1 means "no smoothing", a value of 2 means
     "use previous and next frame", and 5 means "use previous 4 and
     next 4 frames".

3) Select keyframes in Graph Editor.

4) Run 'Smooth Selected Keyframes' tool.

5) Keyframe values will be smoothed.

6) Repeat steps 3 to 5 as required.

You can use the below Python code on a hotkey of your choosing. To
run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.smoothkeyframes.tool as tool

    # Smooth the selected Keyframes
    tool.smooth_selected_keyframes()

    # Open the Smooth Keyframes UI.
    tool.main()

Blend Width
+++++++++++

When the *Smooth Keyframes* tool is run the selected keyframes are
smoothed as well as frames surrounding the selected keyframes. The
surrounding keyframes are blended together with the smoothed
keyframes. The *Blend Width* value controls the number of frames to
blend.

The image below shows the effect of the *Blend Width* value.

.. figure:: images/tools_smooth_keyframes_blend.gif
    :alt: Selected Keyframes Blending Value
    :align: center
    :width: 90%

Function Average
++++++++++++++++

The *Average* smoothing function will average the surrounding keyframe
values equally.

The image below shows the effect of the *Smooth Width* with the
*Average* function.

.. figure:: images/tools_smooth_keyframes_average.gif
    :alt: Smooth Keyframes with Average
    :align: center
    :width: 90%

Function Gaussian
+++++++++++++++++

The *Gaussian* smoothing function performs a strong smooth on the
keyframes. The *Gaussian* function can be used to make a curve very
flat, without any changes. Unlike the *Fourier* function, the
*Gaussian* function will change already smooth keyframes.

This function is similar to 2D image Gaussian blurring.

The image below shows the effect of the *Smooth Width* with the
*Gaussian* function.

.. figure:: images/tools_smooth_keyframes_gaussian.gif
    :alt: Smooth Keyframes with Gaussian
    :align: center
    :width: 90%

Function Fourier
++++++++++++++++

The *Fourier* smoothing function performs a high-pass-filter to the
selected keyframes. Keyframes with rapid changes are smoothed more
than already smoothed values.

This function is similar to 2D image high-pass filtering techniques,
to remove *high-contrast* edge detail.

The image below shows the effect of the *Smooth Width* with the
*Fourier* function.

.. _screen-space-transform-tool-ref:

Screen-Space Transform
----------------------

Convert a Maya transform node into a screen-space transform. This tool
will not modify the originally selected node, but will only create a
new node with new values.

When converting to Screen-Space the Screen Depth is calculated and the
transform node will still match the original transform in World-Space.

This tool may be used to convert an animated object into a
screen-space, then clean up or solve specific attributes, such as
screen X/Y or screen depth.

Usage:

1) Select transform nodes.

2) Activate viewport.

3) Run *Screen-Space Transform Bake* tool.

   - A new locator is created under the active Camera.

4) Delete the keyframes/connects on the selected transform node, using
   ``Channel Box > (Right Click) > Break Connections``.

5) Use a Maya *Point Constraint* to drive the transform(s) from step
   1, with the screen-space transform as the driver.

   - Select screen-space transform node first, then select (step 1)
     transform nodes second and create a *Point Constraint*.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.screenspacetransform.tool as tool
    tool.main()

.. _screen-space-rig-bake-tool-ref:

Screen-Space Rig Bake
---------------------

The `Screen-Space Rig Bake` tool allows users to bake and manipulate
transforms with a `screen-space` rig, separating the X, Y and Z-Depth
components.

The tool can be use to:

 - Smooth a bumpy Z-depth curve.

 - Freeze a transform to a static Z-depth.

Usage:

1) Select a transform node.

2) Open the `Screen-Space Rig Bake` UI.

3) Type a name in the `Name` field (at the bottom of the window).

4) Right-click the `Rigs` pane and select `Create Screen-Space Rig`.

   - Make sure to activate the viewport with a camera to bake the
     object into.

   - A set of nodes named `NAME_screenSpaceRig` will be created.

5) Edit the created `NAME_screenSpaceRig` node.

6) Once finished editing, open the UI again, select the screen-space
   rig control, right-click the `Rigs` pane and select `Bake Rig`.

   - This will bake the original transform node, and delete the nodes.

   - Set the option `Full bake` or `Smart bake` to choose how many
     keyframes will be baked.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.screenspacerigbake.tool as tool
    tool.open_window()

.. _create-screen-space-motion-trail-tool-ref:

Create Screen-Space Motion Trail
--------------------------------

The Screen-Space Motion Trail tool creates a non-editable curve that
shows the screen-space position of a transform across multiple frames.

With default options the tool can be used to visualise the shutter
time of a Marker (or any other transform), assuming a shutter angle of
180 degrees (half a frame).

The user may change the default options after the motion trail is
created by selecting the Motion Trail node under the camera and
editing the attributes in the Channel Box.

Beware of small *increment* values, and large frame ranges. These will
cause slow-downs in the playback of the Maya scene.

.. _sort-selected-nodes-in-outliner-tool-ref:

Sort Selected Nodes In Outliner
-------------------------------

Alphabetically sorts (re-orders) the selected nodes in the Maya Outliner window.

This tool avoids the Maya Outliner window's (interactive) "Sort Order" feature
and encourages an organised workflow when working with many nodes.

This tool works on *any* Transform node, not only mmSolver nodes.

.. figure:: images/sort_nodes_in_outliner_compare.png

    tool.main()

.. _reparent-under-node-tool-ref:

Reparent Under Node
-------------------

This is equivalent to Maya's *Parent* tool (`p` hotkey), except the
tool will maintain the world-space position of the transform node for
each keyframe applied to the node.

Usage:

1) Select nodes to change parent, then select the new parent node.

   - The first nodes will become the children of the last selected node.

   - The last node is the new parent.

2) Run tool.

   - The first nodes are now parented under the last selected node,
     and will stay in the same position in world-space for all
     keyframes.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.reparent.tool as tool
    tool.reparent_under_node()

.. _unparent-to-world-tool-ref:

Unparent to World
-----------------

This is equalivent to Maya's *Unparent* tool (`Shift + p` hotkey), except the tool will
maintain the world-space position of the transform node for each
keyframe applied to the node.

Usage:

1) Select Maya transform node(s).

   - The nodes may be in a deep hierarchy, or not.

2) Run tool.

   - The nodes will maintain the same world-space position, but will
     be unparented into root Maya Outliner (the nodes will not be
     parented under any node).

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.reparent.tool as tool
    tool.unparent_to_world()

.. _remove-solver-nodes-tool-ref:

Remove Solver Nodes
-------------------

Remove Solver Nodes tool allows for the removal of 
some or all nodes related to the matchmoveSolver 
plugin, allowing for a clean scene to be prepped 
to passed to other departments/vendors.

.. figure:: images/tools_remove_solver_nodes_ui.png
    :alt: Remove Solver Nodes UI
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

Usage:

1) Run tool.

   - A UI will open.

2) Select what type of nodes you wish to remove.

3) Click 'Clean'.

Note that if there are other nodes constrained or 
connected in some way to the marker or bundle 
nodes they should be cleaned or baked before 
removal.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.removesolvernodes.tool as tool
    tool.main()

.. _create-remove-controller-tool-ref:

Create / Remove Controller
--------------------------

Create a new transform node to control another node. The `Controller`
transform node can have a separate hierarchy than the source node.

The UI for this tool can be used control the baking method, and the
'space' of the created controller. These features create a very
powerful workflow for editing, and solving characters and objects.

Usage:

1) Select a Maya transform node.

2) Open 'Create Controller' tool UI.

3) Type a name for the controller

4) Select your 'pivot object' and press 'Pick Selection'.

5) Select your 'main object' and press 'Pick Selection'.

6) Select your options for 'Type', 'Bake' mode, and 'Space'.

   - 'Type' changes the node types created for the controller. Choose
     "Group" if you do not like to see locators in your viewport.

   - 'Bake' changes the method used to bake keyframe times. Choose
     'Full Bake' to bake every frame, and choose 'Smart Bake' to bake
     some frames.

   - 'Space' changes the heirachy and orientation of the Controller
     nodes. Using 'Screen Space' allows you to move an object in
     screen-space, with X and Y the position on the screen, and Z the
     depth into the screen. This can be very helpful for smoothing
     Z-bumps and depth problems.

7) Press 'Create Controller' button.

   - A new 'Controller' node is created at the same position as the
     'pick object'.

8) Select and move the created Controller as you wish.

9) Select the Controller, run 'Remove Controller' tool.

   - The source node is baked and the Controller node is deleted.

To run the tool, use this Python command:
