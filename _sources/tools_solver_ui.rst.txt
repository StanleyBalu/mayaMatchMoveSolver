Solver UI
=========

The Solver UI is the primary interface to using the internal solver
command (`mmSolver`).

    Solver User Interface

The shelf tools will open or run the solver.

Input Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/tools_solver_ui_widget_objects.png
    :alt: Solver Input Objects
    :align: right
    :scale: 60%

The Objects are the inputs to the current Solve. This will display
of Markers used for detecting deviation.
To display the Markers, and the related objects, you may turn on/off
the ``CAM``, ``MKR`` and ``BND`` buttons.

There are various columns showing attributes of the input Objects.
To display the column visibility, use the Edit menu.

.. list-table:: Input Object Fields
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Node
     - The input Object's Node.

   * - Status
     - The status of the input object; tick (✓), cross (❌) or dash
       (—).

       If the Solver detects an object is not used by the solver, it
       will be disabled and marked with a cross mark.  Otherwise, a
       tick mark is displayed. If the object's status has not been
       detected the status is a dash mark.

   * - Weight
     - The weight the Marker will have in the solver. Higher values
       give an importance to this Marker, at the expense of other
       Markers.

   * - Frame Deviation
     - The deviation, in pixels, of the Marker on the current frame.

   * - Average Deviation
     - The average deviation, in pixels, of the Marker across all
       valid frames.

   * - Maximum Deviation
     - The maximum deviation and frame number on the Marker.

Output Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/tools_solver_ui_widget_attributes.png
    :alt: Solver Output Attributes
    :align: right
    :scale: 60%

This section of the UI shows the Attributes solved.

.. list-table:: Output Object Fields
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Attr
     - The ``Attribute`` column displays nodes and attributes added
       into the active Collection.

   * - Status
     - The status of the attribute; tick (✓), cross (❌) or dash (—).

       If an attribute cannot be modified by any Marker, then the
       attribute status is set to a cross. Otherwise, attributes that
       are valid have a tick mark. If the attributes's status has not
       been detected the status is a dash mark.

   * - State
     - The State column displays if the attribute is Static or
       Animated.

Solver Tabs
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Solver tabs define the different solvers and the options for each
solver. The different solvers tabs share options, such as frame range,
but each Solver tab is independent.

The documentation for each Solver tab is below.

Python Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commands below are available for this tool, and allow hotkeys or
custom buttons to be created.

Open the Solver UI window:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.solver.tool as solver
    solver.open_window()

Run the solve, just as if the user presses the "Solve" button in the UI:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.solver.tool as solver
    solver.run_solve()

Run the solve, with the "Override Current Frame" checkbox turned *on*:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.solver.tool as solver
    solver.run_solve_on_current_frame()

Run the solve, with the "Override Current Frame" checkbox turned *off*:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.solver.tool as solver
    solver.run_solve_on_all_frames()
