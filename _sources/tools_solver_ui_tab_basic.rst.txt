    Solver Basic Tab

The Basic solver will *only* solve animated attributes.
Static attributes will not be solved.

The Basic solver tab contains a stripped-down solver with minimal
options designed for simple per-frame animated attribute solving.

For many simple uses the Basic solver is all that is required.
