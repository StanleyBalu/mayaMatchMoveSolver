Tutorials
=========

The videos below explain different aspects of mmSolver.

All official videos can be found on the mmSolver `YouTube Channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndLPvFXd9Os7m9sc2Bbbsw>`_

Usage Guide
-----------

These videos explain the use of the Solver UI, and mmSolver shelf. Many
features are explored and show examples for how the tools can be used.

These video uses mmSolver v0.2.0 (beta).

Using 3DEqualizer with mmSolver - Copy 2D Tracks
------------------------------------------------

This video explains how to take 2D tracking data from 3DEqualizer and load it into Maya, for use in mmSolver.

For more information, see the
`Copy 2D Tracks tool
<https://david-cattermole.github.io/mayaMatchMoveSolver/tools_createnode.html#copy-2d-tracks-from-3dequalizer>`_
and
`Copy Camera to Clipboard tool
<https://david-cattermole.github.io/mayaMatchMoveSolver/tools_generaltools.html#copy-camera-to-clipboard>`_
documentation.

This video uses mmSolver v0.3.6.

Thanks to Patcha Saheb for making this video.

Camera and Object Solve
-----------------------

How to line up a camera with known (surveyed) 3D positions, and solve
a camera and object track. The video explains the basic usage of
mmSolver.

This video uses mmSolver v0.2.0 (beta).

Multi-Camera and Object Solve
-----------------------------

Using mmSolver to solve multiple cameras; solving a shot camera,
witness camera and object track. We do not need to have shared 2D
tracking information in order to solve using multiple cameras. The
demonstration also shows the Smooth Keyframes tool, used to smooth an
animation curve then re-solve. A single frame camera line-up for
multiple cameras is also shown.

This video uses mmSolver v0.2.1.

Hierarchical Object Solve
-------------------------

This video covers installation and solving a Head and Jaw control of a
rig. The full installation instructions are
`here <https://github.com/david-cattermole/mayaMatchMoveSolver/blob/master/INSTALL.md>`_.
This video uses mmSolver v0.1.1.

.. note::

    The video does not mention the need to install for Qt.py. If
    working in a production environment, this may already be installed.
    If it is not installed, please see the full installation
    instructions linked above for details.

Character Rotomation Solving
----------------------------

This video explains some workflows and techniques for solving characters.

This video uses v0.3.1, newer versions will contain bug fixes and
features to improve this workflow.

Nodal Camera and Object Solve
-----------------------------

This video explains the basic usage of mmSolver, solving individual
rotation attributes for an eye, and a nodal camera. This video uses a
beta version of mmSolver and will look different from the latest
release.

Solving Door Motion with an Edge
--------------------------------

This video by Michael Karp shows how to use mmSolver to solve the
position of a static table in a 3D scene, after a camera has already
been tracked.

Secondly, a door rotation is solved by tracking the edge of
door. Using this technique, the tracked 2D marker node does not need
to stick to the same feature on the door, only the edge of the door.
