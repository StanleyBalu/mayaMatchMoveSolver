    Enable `MM Renderer` in the "Renderer" menu on each Viewport.

`MM Renderer` is different from regular Viewport 2.0 because it has
the following features:

- Display of MM Image Plane nodes with native useBackground shaders.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use `MM Renderer`, simply load the ``mmSolver`` plug-in (for
example open the Solver UI to ensure the plug-in is loaded), then
use the Viewport's "Renderer" menu to switch to ``MM Renderer``.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MM Renderer` is *beta* software and is only released in ``beta``
versions of `MM Solver`.  There are numerous bugs and issues that are
not yet resolved and the viewport renderer is available as a preview
only.
