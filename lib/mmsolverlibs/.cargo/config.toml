# The "crt-static" target feature is disabled, so that the dynamic C
# RunTime (CRT) library is used.

# SSE4.2 and AVX2 instructions are enabled.
# "fma" (three-operand fused multiple-add) is enabled too.

#
# NOTE: Using "fma" may cause slight differences (but more accurate
# *with* FMA) in floating point calculations. This may cause some
# drift from the same calculation performed in C++.
