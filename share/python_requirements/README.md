# Python Package Requirement Files

This directory is the home to "requirements.txt" files, which are used
by Python's PIP package manager to install python packages.

There are different files for different usages. The "github"
requirement files are used by various GitHub actions, and are reduced
to the minimum required dependencies, to improve speed of the GitHub
actions.
